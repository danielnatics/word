      <h2>Here are some tips to get started:</h2>
      <div>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Choose a Bible study topic: There are many different topics to
            explore in the Bible, such as forgiveness, love, salvation, or
            prayer. Choose a topic that speaks to your heart and resonates with
            your current spiritual journey.
          </li>
          <li>
            Set aside time for Bible study: Make Bible study a priority in your
            life. Set aside a specific time each day or week to dive into the
            Word of God. It may be helpful to find a quiet space where you can
            focus and connect with the text.
          </li>
          <li>
            Engage in discussion: Bible study is not just about reading the text
            but also about engaging in discussion and sharing insights with
            others. Find a group or a friend to study with and discuss the text
            together.
          </li>
          <li>
            Apply what you learn: The Bible is not just a book to be read, but a
            guidebook for life. As you study, think about how you can apply the
            lessons and teachings to your daily life. This will help you deepen
            your connection to God and live a more meaningful life.

            <li>
              "For judgment is without mercy to one who has shown no mercy.
              Mercy triumphs over judgment." - James 2:13
            </li>
            <li>

            </li>
            <li>
              "Who is a God like you, pardoning iniquity and passing over
              transgression for the remnant of his inheritance? He does not
              retain his anger forever, because he delights in steadfast love."

              "Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not
              boast, it is not proud. It does not dishonor others, it is not
              self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of
              wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth.

              are my disciples, if you love one another." - John 13:34-35
            </li>
            <li>
              "This is how we know what love is: Jesus Christ laid down his life
              for us. And we ought to lay down our lives for our brothers and
              sisters." - 1 John 3:16
            </li>
            <li>
